# Earth Day Tweets

For my map I chose to change the parameters to look for two key words "Earth Day". I also changed the search time to allow for the crawler to search for three minutes opposed to one because there weren't many results when I only allowed for one minute.

What I find interesting about this map is that there doesn't exactly seem to be a pattern. But something that is noticeable about it the data points is that they seem to be collected toward the southern half of the United States, although there are obviously exceptions like Wisconsin and New York. To me this doesn't say anything about a pattern because the West Coast of the United States is supposed to be the part of the country that cares about the environment the most. So if there had been clusters on the West Coast that would have signalled a pattern to me. But the one thing that does make sense is there being multiple points collected near bigger cities. Since there are more people in bigger cities there it is more likely to have more activity there.
